SECTION 2: GESTATIONAL DIABETES MELLITUS (GDM) (سكري الحمل)
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

📋 DEFINITION:
Gestational Diabetes Mellitus (GDM) is glucose intolerance first recognized 
during pregnancy. It typically develops around 24-28 weeks when pregnancy 
hormones can block insulin action.

1-hour: ≥ 180 mg/dL (10.0 mmol/L)
2-hour: ≥ 153 mg/dL (8.5 mmol/L)
*One or more elevated values diagnoses GDM

TWO-STEP APPROACH:
Step 1 - 50g glucose challenge test (non-fasting):
- If ≥ 140 mg/dL → proceed to Step 2
Step 2 - 100g OGTT (fasting):
- Fasting: ≥ 95 mg/dL
- 1-hour: ≥ 180 mg/dL
- 2-hour: ≥ 155 mg/dL
- 3-hour: ≥ 140 mg/dL
*Two or more elevated values diagnoses GDM

📊 RISK FACTORS:

HIGH RISK:

   - Avoid: sugary drinks, white bread, pastries, candy
   - Emphasize: vegetables, lean proteins, whole grains, healthy fats
   
   EXERCISE:
   - Moderate activity 30 minutes daily (if approved)
   - Walking after meals particularly beneficial
   - Avoid high-impact or contact sports
   
   MONITORING:
   - Blood glucose testing 4x daily minimum:
     * Fasting (upon waking)
     * 1 or 2 hours after each meal
   - Keep detailed food and glucose log
   - Weekly weight monitoring

2. MEDICAL MANAGEMENT (if diet/exercise insufficient):
   
   Medications:
   - Insulin (first-line pharmacotherapy)
     * Starting doses typically 0.7-1.0 units/kg/day
     * Adjust based on glucose readings
   - Metformin (alternative, some practitioners)
   - Glyburide (less commonly used)

🔬 MONITORING SCHEDULE:

Maternal:
- Blood glucose: 4-7 times daily
- HbA1c: Monthly (if on medication)
- Blood pressure: Each visit
- Weight: Weekly

Fetal:
- Ultrasound for growth: Every 3-4 weeks (starting at 28-32 weeks)
- Non-stress tests: Weekly starting at 32-34 weeks (if on medication)
- Amniotic fluid assessment
- Fetal movement counting

🏥 COMPLICATIONS TO PREVENT:

Maternal Complications:
- Preeclampsia (2x increased risk)
- Cesarean delivery (increased risk)
- Type 2 diabetes later in life (50% within 10 years)
- Recurrent GDM in future pregnancies (up to 50%)

Fetal/Neonatal Complications:
- Macrosomia (large baby >4kg)
- Birth trauma (shoulder dystocia)

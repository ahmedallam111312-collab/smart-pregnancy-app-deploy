--- General Pregnancy Information ---
- Normal pregnancy duration is 40 weeks.
- Healthy weight gain is typically 11-16 kg.
- Fetal movements should be felt daily, typically starting around 18-25 weeks. The 'count to 10' method is common: 10 movements in 2 hours is a good sign.

--- Blood Pressure (BP) ---
- Normal BP: < 120/80 mmHg
- Elevated BP: 120-129 / < 80 mmHg
- Hypertension Stage 1: 130-139 / 80-89 mmHg
- **Preeclampsia Risk**: A reading of >= 140/90 mmHg after 20 weeks gestation is a major warning sign. Requires immediate medical attention. Other symptoms include severe headaches, vision changes, and upper abdominal pain.

--- Blood Glucose ---
- **Gestational Diabetes Mellitus (GDM)** screening is crucial.
- Normal Fasting Blood Glucose: < 92 mg/dL
- GDM diagnosis if Fasting Glucose is >= 92 mg/dL.
- Values between 92-125 mg/dL on fasting test suggest GDM.

--- Hemoglobin (Hb) ---
- Anemia is common in pregnancy.
- Normal Hb levels:
  - 1st Trimester: > 11 g/dL
  - 2nd Trimester: > 10.5 g/dL
  - 3rd Trimester: > 11 g/dL
- Mild Anemia: Hb 10.0-10.9 g/dL
- Moderate Anemia: Hb 7.0-9.9 g/dL. May require iron supplements and follow-up.
- Severe Anemia: Hb < 7.0 g/dL. High risk, requires urgent medical intervention.

--- Urgency Levels ---
- **High Urgency**: Conditions that could be life-threatening. E.g., BP >= 140/90, severe anemia, severe headache, no fetal movement for a long period. Advise immediate contact with a doctor or emergency services.
- **Medium Urgency**: Abnormal but not immediately life-threatening values. E.g., mild/moderate anemia, elevated fasting glucose. Advise scheduling a doctor's appointment soon.
- **Low Urgency**: Minor symptoms or slight deviations from normal. E.g., mild morning sickness, slight fatigue. Advise monitoring and mentioning at the next check-up.
- **Normal**: All values and symptoms are within healthy ranges. Reassure the patient.
